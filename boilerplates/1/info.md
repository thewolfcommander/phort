# Simple Django App with SQLite3

## Overview
This setup is ideal for small-scale projects or prototypes. It uses SQLite3, a lightweight database that is easy to configure and doesn't require a separate server.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Django (latest version)
- Basic knowledge of Django and SQLite3

## Configuration
- The database is configured to use SQLite3 by default in Django's `settings.py`.
- No additional database server setup is required.

## Usage
After setting up the project, you can start developing your Django application immediately. SQLite3 is file-based, so no additional database configuration is needed.

## Limitations
- SQLite3 is not suitable for high-load, large-scale applications.
- It lacks certain features found in more robust databases like PostgreSQL or MySQL.
